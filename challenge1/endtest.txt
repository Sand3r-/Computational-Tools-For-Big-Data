==History==
Founded in 1946, the club played in local leagues and the [[Vierde Klasse]] until 1966. It then had only run in the [[Derde Klasse]] that lasted until 1974 and ended with SV Marken's first section championship. The season after, ending in 1975, it achieved its second championship in the [[Tweede Klasse]] and made it for 2 years into the [[Eerste Klasse]] until relegation. The second run in the Tweede lasted considerably longer and ended with a 3rd championship in 1984.

In the [[1985â€“86 KNVB Cup]] SV Marken created a sensation when it reached the quarterfinals, losing just 0-1 against the professional side [[FC Den Haag]].&lt;ref name=nd010569964&gt;{{cite news|title=Nederlaag voor Marken in kwartfinale|work=[[Nederlands Dagblad]]|location=[[Amersfoort]]|date=1986-04-24|accessdate=2017-08-20|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010569964:mpeg21:a0091|quote=Afgelopen dinsdagavond ontmoette zaterdagamateurclub Marken [[FC Den Haag]] in de kwartfinale om de [[KNVB Cup|KNVB-beker]]. Op [[IJsselmeervogels]] na is nog nooit een amateurclub zover doorgedrongen in het toernooi om de KNVB-beker. [...] Door een fout van Marken-doelman John Koks ging FC Den Haag uiteindelijk met een magere 0-1 winst strijken.}}&lt;/ref&gt; No club but [[IJsselmeervogels]] had made it to it so far in National Cup before SV Marken.&lt;ref name=nd010569964/&gt; The home game for Marken was played in neighboring [[Volendam]] so sufficient football supporters could attend the game.&lt;ref name=nd010569964/&gt;

From 1984 to 2006 SV Marken spent most seasons in the Eerste Klasse with 3 year and 4 year runs in the [[Hoofdklasse]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During these years it achieved its best leagues result ever, 4th place in Hoofdklasse, in 1997 and secured an Eerste Klasse championship in 2001.

Since 2006 the Marken men play mostly Tweede Klasse again with an interlude in the Eerste Klasse from 2010 to 2014. In 2017 Marken promoted from 7th position [[Tweede Klasse]] into the Eerste Klasse.
