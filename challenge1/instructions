Output the number of matches, and then just the matches (the string that matches). Use one row for the number of matches and one row for each match. Like:

the cat in the hat
the cat with the hat
the cat has a hat

Q Can we assume that the strings given are whole single words or do we need to be able to hande multiple words in a string, or partial words?

A It can be multiple and partial words

Q So this could be a query to test?
"na fish" [4,9] "oon run"

A Yes
